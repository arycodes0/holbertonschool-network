# Networking Basics

## OSI Model

The OSI Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven different layers. It provides a guideline for how different software and hardware components should interact with each other.

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN is a network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or school. It is typically used for local communication and sharing resources among devices.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, connecting multiple LANs together. It is commonly used to connect devices across different cities or countries.

## Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected devices that allows for communication and information sharing on a global scale. It is accessed through Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and is based on the TCP/IP protocol.

## IP Address

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, while IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers.

## Localhost

Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device, which allows it to communicate with itself. It is commonly used for testing and development purposes.

## Subnet

A subnet is a smaller network created by dividing a larger network into multiple smaller networks. It helps in managing and organizing IP addresses within a network.

## IPv6

IPv6 was created to address the limitations of IPv4, such as the limited number of available IP addresses. It uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a significantly larger number of unique addresses.

## TCP/UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are the two main protocols used for data transfer over IP networks. The main difference between them is that TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP provides unreliable, connectionless communication.

## Port

A port is a logical construct that allows multiple applications or services to use the same IP address on a device. It helps in identifying specific processes or services running on a device.

## SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers

- SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443

## Network Connectivity Check

The ping tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network. It sends a small packet of data to a specific IP address and waits for a response to determine if the device is reachable.
